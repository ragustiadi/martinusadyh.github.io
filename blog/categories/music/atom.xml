    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10243554@N02/4672153439/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4672153439_9c4d9da140.jpg" alt="The Silent Force" /></a>T-Net&hellip; diwarnet inilah awalnya saya mendengarkan lagu dari album &ldquo;The Silent Force&rdquo; ini, T-Net jugalah warnet satu-satu-nya di Kediri yang kental dengan nuansa METAL karena semua operator-nya maniak musik-musik cadas (hii Ux, kang Ed) dan ada juga operator yang side job-nya adalah ngebuka kursus gitar (kadang-kadang jadi panitia konser punk juga klo ga salah) :D :) Gara-gara album ini juga, saya akhirnya menjadi penggemar aliran Symphonic/Gothic Metal dan mulai mencari-cari band dengan aliran sejenis yang akhirnya ketemu dengan Nightwish, Epica, Lacuna Coil, After Forever, Delain dan Xandria :) Sebenarnya masih banyak lagi sih band-band yang lain, cuma saya belum sempat dengerin musiknya :D :)</p>

<p>The Silent Force ini merupakan album ketiga dari Within Temptation yang di release pada tanggal 15 November 2004 oleh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUN_Records">Gun Records</a>. Album ini di release tiga versi yaitu <strong>basic version</strong>, <strong>standart version</strong> dan <strong>premium version</strong>, untuk <strong>premium version</strong> terdapat 2 bonus track :) Kabar lainnya adalah album ini meraih Gold status di negara Jerman, Belanda, Belgia dan Finlandia setelah 1 minggu di release. Dan pada tanggal 5 Agustus 2008, album &ldquo;The Silent Force&rdquo; beserta album &ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo; di release di Amerika dibawah bendera Roadrunner Records.</p>

<p>Yang mengejutkan lagi, album The Silent Force ini (atau setidaknya judul album ini) terinspirasi dari judul buku pada awal abad ke 19 yang ditulis oleh penulis Belanda yang masa muda-nya dahulu pernah bersekolah di Batavia (sekarang Jakarta &ndash; Indonesia) bernama <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couperus">Louis Couperus</a>. Pernyataan ini dikatakan sendiri oleh Sharon den Adel dalam sebuah wawancara dengan Buzznet yang membahas judul album, dan inilah kutipan Sharon den Adel tersebut :</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The title of our latest album &lsquo;The Silent Force&rsquo; is actually taken from the title of a book from the beginning of the 19th century from a Dutch writer (who lived in Indonesia when he was young) called Louis Couperus. All the songs on this album are in some way related to that book (or at least the title).&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Intro</strong>
[Instrumental]</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>See Who I Am</strong>
Is it true what they say,
Are we too blind to find the way?
Fear of the unknown cloud our hearts today.
Come into my world,
See through my eyes.
Try to understand,
Don&rsquo;t want to lose what we have</p></li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;ve been dreaming
But who can deny,
It&rsquo;s the best way of living
Between the truth and the lies</p>

<p>See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let&rsquo;s show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,
This is not the end.</p>

<p>Fear is withering the soul
At the point of no return.
We must be the change
We wish to see.
I&rsquo;ll come into your world,
See through your eyes.
I&rsquo;ll try to understand,
Before we lose what we&rsquo;ve had.</p>

<p>We just can&rsquo;t stop believing
&lsquo;Cause we have to try.
We can rise above
Their truth and their lies.</p>

<p>See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let&rsquo;s show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,</p>

<p>See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let&rsquo;s show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,
This is not the end.</p>

<p>Hear the silence
Preaching my blame.
Will our strength remain
If their power reigns?</p>

<p>See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let&rsquo;s show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,</p>

<p>See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let&rsquo;s show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,
This is not the end.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Jillian (I&rsquo;d Give My Heart)</strong>
I&rsquo;ve been dreaming for so long,
to find a meaning to understand.
The secret of life,
why am I here to try again?</li>
</ol>


<p>Will I always, will you always
see the truth when it stares you in the face?
Will I ever, will I never free myself
by breaking these chains?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d give my heart, I&rsquo;d give my soul.
I&rsquo;d turn it back, it&rsquo;s my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
have to live till it&rsquo;s undone.
I&rsquo;d give my heart, I&rsquo;d give my soul.
I&rsquo;d turn it back and then at last I&rsquo;ll be on my way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been living for so long,
many seasons have passed me by.
I&rsquo;ve seen kingdoms through ages
rise and fall, I&rsquo;ve seen it all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the horror, I&rsquo;ve seen the wonders
happening just in front of my eyes.
Will I ever, will I never free myself by making it right?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d give my heart, I&rsquo;d give my soul.
I&rsquo;d turn it back, it&rsquo;s my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
have to live till it&rsquo;s undone.
I&rsquo;d give my heart, I&rsquo;d give my soul.
I&rsquo;d turn it back and then at last I&rsquo;ll be on my way.</p>

<p>Jillian our dream ended long ago.
All our stories and all our glory I held so dear.
We won&rsquo;t be together
for ever and ever, no more tears.
I&rsquo;ll always be here until the end.
Jillian, no more tears
Jillian, no more tears</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d give my heart, I&rsquo;d give my soul.
I&rsquo;d turn it back, it&rsquo;s my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
have to live till it&rsquo;s undone.
I&rsquo;d give my heart, I&rsquo;d give my soul.
I&rsquo;d turn it back and then at last I&rsquo;ll be on my way.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Stand My Ground</strong>
I can see
when you stay low nothing happens
Does it feel right?</li>
</ol>


<p>Late at night
things I thought I&rsquo;d put behind me
haunt my mind</p>

<p>I just know there&rsquo;s no escape now
once it&rsquo;s set its eyes on you
but I won&rsquo;t run, have to stare it in the eye</p>

<p>Stand my ground, I won&rsquo;t give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won&rsquo;t close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don&rsquo;t make it, someone else will
Stand My Ground</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all around
getting stronger, coming closer
into my world</p>

<p>I can feel
that it&rsquo;s time for me to face it
can I take it?</p>

<p>Though this might just be the ending
of the life I held so dear
but I won&rsquo;t run, there&rsquo;s no turning back from here</p>

<p>Stand my ground, I won&rsquo;t give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won&rsquo;t close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don&rsquo;t make it, someone else will
Stand My Ground</p>

<p>All I know for sure is I&rsquo;m trying
I will always stand my ground</p>

<p>Stand my ground, I won&rsquo;t give in (I won&rsquo;t give in)
I won&rsquo;t give up (I won&rsquo;t give up)
no more denying, I got to face it
won&rsquo;t close my eyes and hide the truth inside
if I don&rsquo;t make it, someone else will</p>

<p>Stand my ground, I won&rsquo;t give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won&rsquo;t close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don&rsquo;t make it, someone else will
Stand My Ground.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Pale</strong>
The world seems not the same,
Though I know nothing has changed.
It&rsquo;s all my state of mind,
I can&rsquo;t leave it all behind.
Have to stand up to be stronger.</li>
</ol>


<p>Have to try to break free
From the thoughts in my mind.
Use the time that I have,
I can&rsquo;t say goodbye,
Have to make it right.
Have to fight, cause I know
In the end it&rsquo;s worthwhile,
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away.
It will be alright.</p>

<p>I know, should realize
Time is precious, it is worthwhile.
Despite how I feel inside,
Have to trust it&rsquo;ll be all right.
Have to stand up to be stronger.</p>

<p>I have to try to break free
From the thoughts in my mind.
Use the time that I have,
I can&rsquo;t say goodbye,
Have to make it right.
Have to fight, cause I know
In the end it&rsquo;s worthwhile,
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away.
It will be all right.</p>

<p>Oh, this night is too long.
Have no strength to go on.
No more pain, I&rsquo;m floating away.
Through the mist see the face
Of an angel, who calls my name.
I remember you&rsquo;re the reason I have to stay.</p>

<p>Have to try to break free
From the thoughts in my mind.
Use the time that I have,
I can&rsquo;t say goodbye,
Have to make it right.
Have to fight, cause I know
In the end it&rsquo;s worthwhile,
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away.
It will be alright.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Forsaken</strong>
Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time</li>
</ol>


<p>We lived our lives in our paradise,
As gods we shaped the world around
No borderlines we&rsquo;d stay behind,
Though balance is something fragile</p>

<p>While we thought we were gaining,
We&rsquo;d turn back the tide, it still slips away
Our time has run out, our future has doubt,
There&rsquo;s no more escape</p>

<p>Now the day has come,
We are forsaken,
There&rsquo;s no time anymore
Life will pass us by,
We are forsaken,
We&rsquo;re the last of our kind</p>

<p>The sacrifice was much too high,
Our greed just made us all go blind
We tried to hide what we feared inside
Today is the end of tomorrow</p>

<p>As the sea started rising,
The land that we conquered just washed away
Although we all have tried to turn back the tide,
It was all in vain</p>

<p>Now the day has come,
We are forsaken,
There&rsquo;s no time anymore
Life will pass us by, we are forsaken,
Only ruins stay behind</p>

<p>Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time</p>

<p>Now the day has come,
We are forsaken,
There&rsquo;s no time anymore</p>

<p>Now the day has come
The day has come
The day has come.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Angels</strong>
Sparkling angel I believe
You were my savior in my time of need.
Blinded by faith I couldn&rsquo;t hear
All the whispers, the warnings so clear.
I see the angels,
I&rsquo;ll lead them to your door.
There&rsquo;s no escape now,
No mercy no more.
No remorse cause I still remember</li>
</ol>


<p>The smile when you tore me apart.
You took my heart,
Deceived me right from the start.
You showed me dreams,
I wished they&rsquo;d turn into real.
You broke a promise and made me realize.
It was all just a lie.</p>

<p>Sparkling angel, I couldn&rsquo;t see
Your dark intentions, your feelings for me.
Fallen angel, tell me why?
What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?
I see the angels,
I&rsquo;ll lead them to your door
There&rsquo;s no escape now
No mercy no more
No remorse cause I still remember</p>

<p>The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart,
Deceived me right from the start.
You showed me dreams,
I wished they&rsquo;d turn into real.
You broke a promise and made me realize.
It was all just a lie.
Could have been forever.
Now we have reached the end.</p>

<p>This world may have failed you,
It doesn&rsquo;t give you reason why.
You could have chosen a different path in life.</p>

<p>The smile when you tore me apart.
You took my heart,
Deceived me right from the start.
You showed me dreams,
I wished they&rsquo;d turn into real.
You broke a promise and made me realize.
It was all just a lie.
Could have been forever.
Now we have reached the end.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Memories</strong>
In this world you tried,
Not leaving me alone behind.
There&rsquo;s no other way,
I pray to the gods let him stay.
The memories ease the pain inside,
And now I know why.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of my memories keep you near.
In silent moments,
Imagining you here.
All of my memories keep you near,
In silent whispers, by silent tears</p>

<p>Made me promise I&rsquo;d try,
To find my way back in this life.
Hope there is a way,
To give me a sign you&rsquo;re okay.
Reminds me again it&rsquo;s worth it all,
So I can go home.</p>

<p>All of my memories keep you near.
In silent moments,
Imagining you here.
All of my memories keep you near.
In silent whispers, by silent tears.</p>

<p>Together in all these memories,
I see your smile.
All of the memories I hold dear.
Darling you know I&rsquo;ll love you,
Til the end of time.</p>

<p>All of my memories keep you near
In silent moments,
Imagining you here.
All of my memories keep you near,
In silent whispers, by silent tears.</p>

<p>All of my memories&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Aquarius</strong>
I hear your whispers
break the silence and it calms me down.
A taste on my lips,
your salty kisses.</li>
</ol>


<p>They say I&rsquo;m seeking out the danger.
That one day you won&rsquo;t let me go.
I&rsquo;ll drown, you&rsquo;ll take me down.</p>

<p>Chorus:
I need you Aquarius,
enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.
You call to me, you set me free.</p>

<p>I relinquish to your powers.
From your grasp, I just can&rsquo;t hide.
I missed the danger I had to conquer.
You made me feel alive.</p>

<p>They say I have to be aware,
that one day you won&rsquo;t let me go.
I&rsquo;ll drown, you&rsquo;ll take me down.</p>

<p>I need you Aquarius,
enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.</p>

<p>I long for you, Aquarius.
I need to be with you again.
I fear you, Aquarius
My destiny till the end.</p>

<p>I need you Aquarius,
enchanted I will have to stay
I feel you Aquarius
cause you the sea set me free.</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>It&rsquo;s the Fear</strong>
It waits for the day I will let it out.
To give it a reason, to give it its might.</li>
</ol>


<p>I fear who I am becoming,
I feel that I am losing the struggle within.
I can no longer restrain it,
My strength it is fading,
I have to give in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the fear
Fear of the dark
It&rsquo;s growing inside of me,
That one day will come to life.
Have to save
To save my beloved,
There is no escape,
Because my faith is horror and doom.</p>

<p>Hold down your head now,
Just let me pass by.
Don&rsquo;t feed my fear,
If you don&rsquo;t want it out.</p>

<p>I fear who I am becoming,
I feel that I am losing all beauty within.
I can no longer restrain it,
My strength is fading.
I have to give in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the fear
Fear of the dark
It&rsquo;s growing inside of me,
That one day will come to life.
Have to save
To save my beloved,
There is no escape,
Because my faith is horror and doom.</p>

<p>Long ago it came to me
And ever since that day,
Infected with its rage
But it ends today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the fear
Fear of the dark
It&rsquo;s growing inside of me,
That one day will come to life.
Have to save
To save my beloved,
There is no escape,
Because my faith is horror and doom.</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>Somewhere</strong>
Lost in the darkness, hoping for a sign
Instead there is only silence,
Can&rsquo;t you hear my screams?
Never stop hoping,
Need to know where you are
But one thing&rsquo;s for sure,
You&rsquo;re always in my heart</li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;ll find you somewhere
I&rsquo;ll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever has happened,
The truth will free my soul</p>

<p>Lost in the darkness, try to find your way home
I want to embrace you and never let you go
Almost hope you&rsquo;re in heaven so no one can hurt your soul
Living in agony &lsquo;cause I just do not know
Where you are</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll find you somewhere
I&rsquo;ll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever&rsquo;s happened,
The truth will free my soul</p>

<p>Wherever you are, I won&rsquo;t stop searching
Whatever it takes me to go</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll find you somewhere
I&rsquo;ll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever&rsquo;s happened,
The truth will free my soul</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>A Dangerous Mind</strong>
I&rsquo;m searching for answers
Cause something is not right.
I follow the signs,
I&rsquo;m close to the fire.</li>
</ol>


<p>I fear that soon you&rsquo;ll reveal
Your dangerous mind.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
I fear your smile and the promise inside.
It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
I fear your presence, I&rsquo;m frozen inside.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m searching for answers
Not questioned before.
The curse of awareness,
There&rsquo;s no peace of mind.
As your true colors show
A dangerous sign.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
I see the truth that you&rsquo;ve buried inside.
It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find.</p>

<p>I just have to know, while I still have time.
Do I have to run, or hide away from you?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
I see the truth that you&rsquo;ve buried inside.
It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
I see the truth that you&rsquo;ve buried inside.
It&rsquo;s in your eyes, what&rsquo;s on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find. I find</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>The Swan Song</strong>
Winter has come for me, can&rsquo;t carry on.
The chains to my life are strong but soon they&rsquo;ll be gone.
I&rsquo;ll spread my wings one more time.</li>
</ol>


<p>Is it a dream?
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.</p>

<p>In my heart I know I can let go.
In the end I will find some peace inside.
New wings are growing tonight.</p>

<p>Is it a dream?
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.</p>

<p>As I am soaring I&rsquo;m one with the wind.
I am longing to see you again, it&rsquo;s been so long.
We will be together again.</p>

<p>Is it a dream?
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.</p>

Ini adalah kutipan perkataan Sharon den Adel tentang soundtrack film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/">Bravehearth</a> <strong>&ldquo;and also we were very much enthralled by a movie at that time, Braveheart, which was very Celtic, and that&rsquo;s how our album became very Celtic because we were so in love with the soundtrack of the Braveheart movie. So, inspired by that, the album came out that way&hellip;I still love that album very much&hellip;it came together in a very natural way.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Sedangkan single untuk album &ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo; ini adalah &ldquo;Our Farewell&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ice Queen&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo; dan &ldquo;Never Ending Story&rdquo;. Keren kan ? Dan dibawah ini adalah kumpulan lyrics untuk album Mother Earth ini :</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Mother Earth</strong>
Birds and butterflies
Rivers and mountains she creates
But you&rsquo;ll never know
The next move she&rsquo;ll make
You can try
But it is useless to ask why
Cannot control her
She goes her own way</li>
</ol>


<p>She rules until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules until the end of time
She goes her way</p>

<p>With every breath
And all the choices that we make
We are only passing through on her way
I find my strength
Believing that their soul lives on
Until the end of time
I&rsquo;ll carry them with me</p>

<p>she rules until the end of time
she gives and she takes
she rules until the end of time
she goes her way</p>

<p>Once you will know my dear
You dont have to fear
A new beginning
Always starts at the end
Once you will know my dear
You dont have to fear &hellip;
Until the end of time x3
She goes her way</p>

<p>she rules until the end of time
she gives and she takes
she rules until the end of time
until the end of time
until the end of time
she goes her way.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Ice Queen</strong>
When leaves have fallen and skies turned to grey
The night keeps on closing in on the day
A nightingale sings his song of farewell
You&rsquo;d better hide from her freezing hell</li>
</ol>


<p>On cold wings she&rsquo;s coming
You&rsquo;d better keep moving
For warmth, you&rsquo;ll be longing
Any day
Come on, just feel it?
Don&rsquo;t you see it?
You&rsquo;d better believe</p>

<p>When she embraces
Your heart turns to stone
She comes at night when you&rsquo;re all alone
And when she whispers
Your blood shall run cold
You&rsquo;d better hide before she finds you</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes a life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes a life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<p>She covers the Earth with a breathtaking cloak
The sun awakes and melts it away
The world now opens its eyes and sees
The dawning of a new day</p>

<p>On cold wings she&rsquo;s coming
You&rsquo;d better keep moving
For warmth, you&rsquo;ll be longing
Any day
Come on you feel it
Don&rsquo;t you see it
You&rsquo;d better believe</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Our Farewell</strong>
In my hands
A legacy of memories
I can hear you say my name
I can almost see your smile
Feel the warmth of your embrace
But there is nothing but silence now
Around the one I loved
Is this our farewell?</li>
</ol>


<p>Sweet darling, you worry too much, my child
See the sadness in your eyes
You are not alone in life
Although you might think that you are</p>

<p>Never thought
This day would come so soon
We had no time to say goodbye
How can the world just carry on?
I feel so lost when you are not at my side
But there is nothing but silence now
Around the one I loved
Is this our farewell?</p>

<p>Sweet darling, you worry too much, my child
See the sadness in your eyes
You are not alone in life
Although you might think that you are</p>

<p>So sorry your world is tumbling down
I&rsquo;ll watch you through these nights
Rest your head and go to sleep
Because my child, this is not our farewell.
This is not our farewell.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Caged</strong>
These are the darkest clouds
That have surrounded me
Now I find my self alone caught in a cage
There&rsquo;s no flower I can find in here
Not withering not pale to me
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside</li>
</ol>


<p>He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind</p>

<p>My heart is covered
With thoughts entangled
How could it ever have felt so real?
Is there a place more lonely than I feel within?
Could I have seen?
Could I have known?
I just took it as the truth
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside</p>

<p>He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind</p>

<p>Always there to remind me
It keeps me from believing
That someone might be there
Who frees me and never ever leaves me</p>

<p>He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>The Promise</strong>
[spoken]
Where are we now?&hellip; we&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; we&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; in heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;
In heaven&hellip;</li>
</ol>


<p>On behalf of her love
She no longer sleeps
Life had no longer meaning
Nothing to make her stay
She sold her soul away</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
You slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed, I believed</p>

<p>After the night he died
I wept my tears until they dried
But the pain stayed the same
I didn&rsquo;t want him to die all in vain
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time
I&rsquo;ll make them bleed down at my feet</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
But you slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder
Could I have known about their true intentions?
As the pain stayed the same
I&rsquo;m going to haunt them down all the way
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time
One by one they were surprised</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
But you slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed</p>

<p>[spoken]
Where are we now?&hellip; We&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; We&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; In heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
But you slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Never Ending Story</strong>
Armies have conquered
And fallen in the end
Kingdoms have risen
Then buried by sand
The Earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
She puts us to sleep
In her light we&rsquo;ll awake
We&rsquo;ll all be forgotten
There&rsquo;s no endless fame
But everything we do
It&rsquo;s never in vain</li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
We&rsquo;re all on this journey
No one&rsquo;s to stay
Where ever it&rsquo;s going
What is the way?</p>

<p>Forests and deserts
Rivers, blue seas
Mountains and valleys
Nothing here stays
While we think we witness
We&rsquo;re part of the scene
This never-ending story
Where will it lead to?
The earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
But she&rsquo;s also a part
A part of the tale</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
We&rsquo;re all on this journey
No one is to stay
Where is it going
What is the way?
We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
We&rsquo;re all on this journey
No one is to stay
Where is it going
What is the way?
We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Deceiver of Fools</strong>
He feeds on fear
He feeds on pain
He rules again
With growing hate
He will guide
Their faith again</li>
</ol>


<p>No light in the darkness
Is too small to see
There&rsquo;s always a sparkle of hope
If you just believe</p>

<p>He told the tale so many times
About the dream not meant to be
In a world of the free</p>

<p>Plays with your mind</p>

<p>As faith for the future faded fast
He grows strong with their displeasure
It sets him free</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again</p>

<p>He feeds on fear
Poisons the truth
To gain their faith
To lead the way
To a world of decay</p>

<p>Rules your heart</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll sell your soul to the grave
Without a hesitation to make
He belongs to the dark</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again</p>

<p>Please awake
And see the truth
He can only be
If you believe what he tells you
Remember who you are
What you stand for
And there will always be a way</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again</p>

<p>In my heart there is a place
In my heart there is a trace
Of a small fire burning
A sheltering ray shines through this night
Although it&rsquo;s small, it&rsquo;s bright
But darkness is lurking</p>

<p>He will sell your soul
To bitterness and cold
Oh fear him</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
Shall he rule again?</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Intro</strong>
[Instrumental]</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Dark Wings</strong>
Why was I one of the chosen ones?
Until the fight I could not see
The magic and the strength of my power
It was beyond my wildest dreams</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us down</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you die on me
You haven&rsquo;t made your peace
Live life, breathe, breathe
Don&rsquo;t you die on me
You haven&rsquo;t made your peace
Live life, breathe, breathe</p>

<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us down</p>

<p>As they took your soul away
The night turned into the day
Blinded by your rays of life
Gave us the strength we needed</p>

<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us</p>

<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us down</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>In Perfect Harmony</strong>
In a world so far away
At the end of a closing day
A little child was born and raised
Deep in the forest on a hidden place
Mother never saw his face</li>
</ol>


<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony</p>

<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony
The woods protected, fulfilled his needs</p>

<p>Fruit by birds, honey by bees</p>

<p>He found shelter under the trees
He grew up in their company
They became his family</p>

<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony</p>

<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony</p>

<p>A thousand seasons
They passed him by
So many times, have said goodbye
And when the spirits called out his name
To join forever, forever to stay
A forest spirit he became</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>Bittersweet</strong>
If I tell you
Will you listen?
Will you stay?
Will you be here forever?
Never go away?</li>
</ol>


<p>Never thought things would change
Hold me tight
Please don&rsquo;t say again
That you have to go</p>

<p>A bitter thought
I had it all
But I just let it go
Oh, this silence
It&rsquo;s so violent
Since your`re gone</p>

<p>All my thoughts are with you forever
Until the day we&rsquo;ll be back together
I will be waiting for you</p>

<p>If I had told you
You would have listened
You had stayed
You would be here forever
Never went away
It would never have been the same
All our time
Would have been in vain
Cause you had to go</p>

<p>The sweetest thought
I had it all
Cause I did let you go
All our moments
Keep me warm
When you&rsquo;re gone</p>

<p>All my thoughts are with you forever
Until the day we&rsquo;ll be back together
I will be waiting for you.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>The Dance</strong>
Someone is dancing on my grave
Sending shivers down my spine.
I hear a laugh, it awoke my soul
The wind takes the leaves where he
Wants them to go
His tunes enchant our world,
Our thoughts and leave us frozen</li>
</ol>


<!-- more -->


<p>In this heart of mine
It&rsquo;s you I find
Take my hand
I&rsquo;ll take you to the promised land
You&rsquo;re the one</p>

<p>I hear a laugh, it awoke my soul
The wind takes the leaves where he
Wants them to go
His tunes enchant our world,
Our thoughts and leave us frozen</p>

<p>In this heart of mine
It&rsquo;s you I find
Take my hand
I&rsquo;ll take you to the promised land
You&rsquo;re the one</p>

<p>Nevil, whatever you have done, these tears
Will fade
Nevil, wherever you have gone,
Please have faith</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Another Day</strong>
I know you&rsquo;re going away
I take my love into another day
In my thoughts you&rsquo;re with me
I fell in love with your ways</li>
</ol>


<p>I know you&rsquo;re going away
Lead my heart into a daze
I know you&rsquo;re going away
Leaves a void in my heart and soul</p>

<p>Wherever you are
Whatever you do
I feel the walls surrounding you</p>

<p>Wherever you are
Whatever you do
I know you are independent
But I&rsquo;m trying to get through to you</p>

<p>Wherever you are
Whatever you do
Don&rsquo;t you know, it depends on you</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>The Other Half (Of me)</strong>
Over the hills lies a new beginning
Over the hills
Over the hills there is a way I know it
Over the hills</li>
</ol>


<p>You can&rsquo;t brighten at the gloom
-Your heart is afraid and so empty
You glorify the future
-Living in a different world than me
This journey ends in death
-You are giving up so easily</p>

<p>You are the other half of me</p>

<p>Over the hills [x4]</p>

<p>We are drifting apart
&ndash; Chilled to the marrow &lsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t want to go</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a different wish at heart
&ndash; The Amulet guides us to other side</p>

<p>When I go down, it&rsquo;s you who&rsquo;ll bleed
&ndash; I&rsquo;m not scared to die, as long as I&rsquo;m with you</p>

<p>You are the other half of me</p>

<p>Over the hills lies a new beginning
Over the hills
Over the hills there is a way I know it
Over the hills</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Restless</strong>
She embraced, with a smile,
as she opened the door.
A cold wind blows,
it puts a chill into her heart.</li>
</ol>


<p>You have taken away the trust,
you&rsquo;re the ghost haunting through her heart.
Past and present are one in her head,
you&rsquo;re the ghost haunting through her heart.</p>

<p>Take my hand as I wander through,
all of my life I gave to you.
Take my hand as I wander through,
all of my love I gave to you.</p>

<p>You have taken away the trust,
you&rsquo;re the ghost haunting through her heart.
Past and present are one in her head,
you&rsquo;re the ghost haunting through her heart.</p>

<p>lailllailllailla&hellip;. lailllailllailla</p>

<p>Take my hand as I wander through,
All of my life I gave to you.
Take my hand as I wander through,
All of my love I gave to you.</p>

<p>laalilalllla&hellip;.. lailai..iii</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Enter</strong>
The gates of time have opened,
Now, it&rsquo;s chains are broken.
An ancient force unleashed again</li>
</ol>


<p>As I enter the portal,
I feel the enchantment
It takes me away, away from here</p>

<p>Come near me,
enter my private chambers,
I want to feel the warmth on my face,
light-in darkness,
lift me up from here.
Give me your wings,
to flee from my ivory tower.</p>

<p>As I enter the portal,
I feel the enchantment
The stars above are lying at my feet.</p>

<p>Come near me,
enter my private chambers,
I want to feel the warmth on my face,
light-in darkness,
lift me up from here.
Give me your wings,
to flee from my ivory tower.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Pearls of Light</strong>
After,
the cold darkness,
in the heart of the forest.
Where birds are singing,
for the new born sun</li>
</ol>


<p>In the womb of the leaves,
on the branches of the trees,
lies the treasure in the morning,
the pearls of light.</p>

<p>Carried away by the truculence of my world,
I got lost in the search for enlightenment,
The blue rain,
Covered my roots and I forgot where I came from.</p>

<p>Carried away by the truculence of my world,
I got lost in the search for enlightment,
The blue rain,
Covered my roots and I forgot where I came from.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Deep Within</strong>
Is there a place deep within
A place where you hide your darkest sins</li>
</ol>


<p>There&rsquo;s a strange kind of ambiance,
its surrounding you
as a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth</p>

<p>Candles die down as you leave the room
In my heart you leave no gloom
As you lure me I know the truth
You&rsquo;re a leprechaun, I see you through.</p>

<p>Is there a place deep within
A place where you hide your darkest sins</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a strange kind of ambiance,
its surrounding you
as a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Gatekeeper</strong>
The shadows of the night,
are unleashed again
Where their greed begins,
the end is near
A morbid hunger for blood,
lies in their cold black eyes
They&rsquo;ve come to take our lifes away</li>
</ol>


<p>One by one they died
A massacre that took all night
They had no chance, it was no fight
You can&rsquo;t kill what has been killed before
They died&hellip;..</p>

<p>With shadows on its tail
He stepped through the portal,
locked the door and ate the key
With his life they took their way to freedom,
and he became the final keeper of the key</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Grace</strong>
Cold are the bones of thy soldiers.
Longing for home, their little paradise.
I don&rsquo;t feel remdeption on their side</li>
</ol>


<p>Fallen from grace, help me rise again.
Fallen from grace, help me through.</p>

<p>Fallen from grace, help me through.
Fallen from grace.</p>

<p>Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble.</p>

<p>Do you hear these words.
Do you feel the wounds.
I&rsquo;ll never help you through.</p>

<p>Cold are thy souls,
I feel the resentment,
they feel betrayed,
They hate the cold
I don&rsquo;t feel redemption on their side.</p>

<p>Fallen from grace, help me rise again.
Fallen from grace, help me through.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Blooded</strong>
[instrumental]</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Candles</strong>
Take away,
These hands of darkness.
Reaching for my soul.
Now, the cold wind, blows out my candles.
Feeling, only fear, without any hope.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>A thousand dark moons.
A thousand winters long.
A million fallen stars, the candle burns in the womb.</p>

<p>We try not to forget, they live through us.
Slowly they die away at every candle&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>A thousand dark moons.
A thousand winters long.
A million fallen stars, the candle burns in the womb.</p>

<p>We trie not to forget, they live through us.
Slowly they die away at every candle&rsquo;s end.</p>

Setelah dicari-cari, ternyata lagunya berasal dari sidebar playlist yang dipasang di blog <a href="http://slackwareband.blogspot.com/">Slackware Band</a> dan kebetulan juga lagu yang dimainkan judulnya Trouble Is A Friend By Lenka. Setelah selesai satu lagu, hmm&hellip;. enak juga nih lagu :D terus iseng-iseng deh cari di <a href="http://youtube.com/">Youtube</a> dan akhir-nya ketemu. Nah kalau penasaran, mungkin bisa langsung play video dibawah ini atau langsung meluncur ke sumber asli-nya <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXtOJvtcuz0">disini</a>.</p>

<p>Berhubung lagunya ini enak selain penyanyi-ya yang cakep :D , iseng-iseng cari lyrics-nya sekalian dan dapat juga :D Lyrics-nya juga ga panjang-panjang amat koq. Nah sebagai dokumentasi pribadi, dibawah ini adalah lyrics <strong>Trouble Is A Friend</strong>-nya Lenka :</p>

<p><strong>Trouble Is A Friend By Lenka</strong>
Trouble he will find you no matter where you go, oh oh
No matter if you&rsquo;re fast, no matter if you&rsquo;re slow, oh oh
The eye of the storm or the cry in the mourn, oh oh
You&rsquo;re fine for a while but you start to lose control</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s there in the dark, he&rsquo;s there in my heart
He waits in the wings, he&rsquo;s gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend, yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh!</p>

<p>Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe, oh oh
And no matter what I feed him he always seems to grow, oh oh
He sees what I see and he knows what I know, oh oh
So don&rsquo;t forget as you ease on down the road</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s there in the dark, he&rsquo;s there in my heart
He waits in the wings, he&rsquo;s gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend, yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh</p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won&rsquo;t let him win, but I&rsquo;m a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend, yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh!</p>

<p>Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave, I try
Oh oh, I try!</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s there in the dark, he&rsquo;s there in my heart
He waits in the wings, he&rsquo;s gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend, yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh</p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won&rsquo;t let him win, but I&rsquo;m a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend, yeah trouble is a friend of mine, oh oh!
Ooo, oh ooo, ooo ahh</p>

<p>Gimana mantap ga ? :D Setelah puas dengerin lagunya, sekarang waktu-nya cari <strong>cord</strong> gitar-nya :D :) Dan coba-coba cari lagi di <a href="http://youtube.com/">Youtube</a> eh ketemu lagi :D , kalau penasaran coba di play aja video dibawah ini atau kalau ga sabar bisa langsung menuju ke sumber-nya <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-JIP6-yAcY">disini</a> : :)</p>
