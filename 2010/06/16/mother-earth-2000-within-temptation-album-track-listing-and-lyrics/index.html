<p>Waw.. menakjubkan sekali, dari 11 lagu diatas merupakan favorit saya semua :D Kkwkwkwwk&hellip;. dan wow&hellip; ternyata album Mother Earth ini terinspirasi oleh soundtrack film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/">Bravehearth</a> yang sedang populer waktu itu. Ini adalah kutipan perkataan Sharon den Adel tentang soundtrack film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/">Bravehearth</a> <strong>&ldquo;and also we were very much enthralled by a movie at that time, Braveheart, which was very Celtic, and that&rsquo;s how our album became very Celtic because we were so in love with the soundtrack of the Braveheart movie. So, inspired by that, the album came out that way&hellip;I still love that album very much&hellip;it came together in a very natural way.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Sedangkan single untuk album &ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo; ini adalah &ldquo;Our Farewell&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ice Queen&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo; dan &ldquo;Never Ending Story&rdquo;. Keren kan ? Dan dibawah ini adalah kumpulan lyrics untuk album Mother Earth ini :</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Mother Earth</strong>
Birds and butterflies
Rivers and mountains she creates
But you&rsquo;ll never know
The next move she&rsquo;ll make
You can try
But it is useless to ask why
Cannot control her
She goes her own way</li>
</ol>


<p>She rules until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules until the end of time
She goes her way</p>

<p>With every breath
And all the choices that we make
We are only passing through on her way
I find my strength
Believing that their soul lives on
Until the end of time
I&rsquo;ll carry them with me</p>

<p>she rules until the end of time
she gives and she takes
she rules until the end of time
she goes her way</p>

<p>Once you will know my dear
You dont have to fear
A new beginning
Always starts at the end
Once you will know my dear
You dont have to fear &hellip;
Until the end of time x3
She goes her way</p>

<p>she rules until the end of time
she gives and she takes
she rules until the end of time
until the end of time
until the end of time
she goes her way.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Ice Queen</strong>
When leaves have fallen and skies turned to grey
The night keeps on closing in on the day
A nightingale sings his song of farewell
You&rsquo;d better hide from her freezing hell</li>
</ol>


<p>On cold wings she&rsquo;s coming
You&rsquo;d better keep moving
For warmth, you&rsquo;ll be longing
Any day
Come on, just feel it?
Don&rsquo;t you see it?
You&rsquo;d better believe</p>

<p>When she embraces
Your heart turns to stone
She comes at night when you&rsquo;re all alone
And when she whispers
Your blood shall run cold
You&rsquo;d better hide before she finds you</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes a life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes a life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<p>She covers the Earth with a breathtaking cloak
The sun awakes and melts it away
The world now opens its eyes and sees
The dawning of a new day</p>

<p>On cold wings she&rsquo;s coming
You&rsquo;d better keep moving
For warmth, you&rsquo;ll be longing
Any day
Come on you feel it
Don&rsquo;t you see it
You&rsquo;d better believe</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<p>Whenever she is raging
She takes life away
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
Haven&rsquo;t you seen
The ruins of her world</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Our Farewell</strong>
In my hands
A legacy of memories
I can hear you say my name
I can almost see your smile
Feel the warmth of your embrace
But there is nothing but silence now
Around the one I loved
Is this our farewell?</li>
</ol>


<p>Sweet darling, you worry too much, my child
See the sadness in your eyes
You are not alone in life
Although you might think that you are</p>

<p>Never thought
This day would come so soon
We had no time to say goodbye
How can the world just carry on?
I feel so lost when you are not at my side
But there is nothing but silence now
Around the one I loved
Is this our farewell?</p>

<p>Sweet darling, you worry too much, my child
See the sadness in your eyes
You are not alone in life
Although you might think that you are</p>

<p>So sorry your world is tumbling down
I&rsquo;ll watch you through these nights
Rest your head and go to sleep
Because my child, this is not our farewell.
This is not our farewell.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Caged</strong>
These are the darkest clouds
That have surrounded me
Now I find my self alone caught in a cage
There&rsquo;s no flower I can find in here
Not withering not pale to me
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside</li>
</ol>


<p>He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind</p>

<p>My heart is covered
With thoughts entangled
How could it ever have felt so real?
Is there a place more lonely than I feel within?
Could I have seen?
Could I have known?
I just took it as the truth
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside</p>

<p>He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind</p>

<p>Always there to remind me
It keeps me from believing
That someone might be there
Who frees me and never ever leaves me</p>

<p>He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>The Promise</strong>
[spoken]
Where are we now?&hellip; we&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; we&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; in heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;
In heaven&hellip;</li>
</ol>


<p>On behalf of her love
She no longer sleeps
Life had no longer meaning
Nothing to make her stay
She sold her soul away</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
You slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed, I believed</p>

<p>After the night he died
I wept my tears until they dried
But the pain stayed the same
I didn&rsquo;t want him to die all in vain
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time
I&rsquo;ll make them bleed down at my feet</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
But you slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder
Could I have known about their true intentions?
As the pain stayed the same
I&rsquo;m going to haunt them down all the way
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time
One by one they were surprised</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
But you slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed</p>

<p>[spoken]
Where are we now?&hellip; We&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; We&rsquo;re almost in heaven
Where are we now?&hellip; In heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;
We&rsquo;re almost in heaven&hellip;</p>

<p>I held you tight to me
But you slipped away
You promised to return to me
And I believed</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Never Ending Story</strong>
Armies have conquered
And fallen in the end
Kingdoms have risen
Then buried by sand
The Earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
She puts us to sleep
In her light we&rsquo;ll awake
We&rsquo;ll all be forgotten
There&rsquo;s no endless fame
But everything we do
It&rsquo;s never in vain</li>
</ol>


<p>We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
We&rsquo;re all on this journey
No one&rsquo;s to stay
Where ever it&rsquo;s going
What is the way?</p>

<p>Forests and deserts
Rivers, blue seas
Mountains and valleys
Nothing here stays
While we think we witness
We&rsquo;re part of the scene
This never-ending story
Where will it lead to?
The earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
But she&rsquo;s also a part
A part of the tale</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
We&rsquo;re all on this journey
No one is to stay
Where is it going
What is the way?
We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
We&rsquo;re all on this journey
No one is to stay
Where is it going
What is the way?
We&rsquo;re part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began.</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>Deceiver of Fools</strong>
He feeds on fear
He feeds on pain
He rules again
With growing hate
He will guide
Their faith again</li>
</ol>


<p>No light in the darkness
Is too small to see
There&rsquo;s always a sparkle of hope
If you just believe</p>

<p>He told the tale so many times
About the dream not meant to be
In a world of the free</p>

<p>Plays with your mind</p>

<p>As faith for the future faded fast
He grows strong with their displeasure
It sets him free</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again</p>

<p>He feeds on fear
Poisons the truth
To gain their faith
To lead the way
To a world of decay</p>

<p>Rules your heart</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll sell your soul to the grave
Without a hesitation to make
He belongs to the dark</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again</p>

<p>Please awake
And see the truth
He can only be
If you believe what he tells you
Remember who you are
What you stand for
And there will always be a way</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again</p>

<p>In my heart there is a place
In my heart there is a trace
Of a small fire burning
A sheltering ray shines through this night
Although it&rsquo;s small, it&rsquo;s bright
But darkness is lurking</p>

<p>He will sell your soul
To bitterness and cold
Oh fear him</p>

<p>Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
Shall he rule again?</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Intro</strong>
[Instrumental]</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Dark Wings</strong>
Why was I one of the chosen ones?
Until the fight I could not see
The magic and the strength of my power
It was beyond my wildest dreams</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us down</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you die on me
You haven&rsquo;t made your peace
Live life, breathe, breathe
Don&rsquo;t you die on me
You haven&rsquo;t made your peace
Live life, breathe, breathe</p>

<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us down</p>

<p>As they took your soul away
The night turned into the day
Blinded by your rays of life
Gave us the strength we needed</p>

<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us</p>

<p>Dark wings they are descending
See shadows gathering around
One by one they are falling
Every time they try to strike us down</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>In Perfect Harmony</strong>
In a world so far away
At the end of a closing day
A little child was born and raised
Deep in the forest on a hidden place
Mother never saw his face</li>
</ol>


<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony</p>

<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony
The woods protected, fulfilled his needs</p>

<p>Fruit by birds, honey by bees</p>

<p>He found shelter under the trees
He grew up in their company
They became his family</p>

<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony</p>

<p>Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony</p>

<p>A thousand seasons
They passed him by
So many times, have said goodbye
And when the spirits called out his name
To join forever, forever to stay
A forest spirit he became</p>

<ol>
<li>. <strong>Bittersweet</strong>
If I tell you
Will you listen?
Will you stay?
Will you be here forever?
Never go away?</li>
</ol>


<p>Never thought things would change
Hold me tight
Please don&rsquo;t say again
That you have to go</p>

<p>A bitter thought
I had it all
But I just let it go
Oh, this silence
It&rsquo;s so violent
Since your`re gone</p>

<p>All my thoughts are with you forever
Until the day we&rsquo;ll be back together
I will be waiting for you</p>

<p>If I had told you
You would have listened
You had stayed
You would be here forever
Never went away
It would never have been the same
All our time
Would have been in vain
Cause you had to go</p>

<p>The sweetest thought
I had it all
Cause I did let you go
All our moments
Keep me warm
When you&rsquo;re gone</p>

<p>All my thoughts are with you forever
Until the day we&rsquo;ll be back together
I will be waiting for you.</p>
