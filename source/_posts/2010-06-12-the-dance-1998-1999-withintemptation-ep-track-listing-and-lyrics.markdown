  1. **The Dance**
Someone is dancing on my grave
Sending shivers down my spine.
I hear a laugh, it awoke my soul
The wind takes the leaves where he
Wants them to go
His tunes enchant our world,
Our thoughts and leave us frozen 
<!-- more -->
In this heart of mine
It's you I find
Take my hand
I'll take you to the promised land
You're the one 

I hear a laugh, it awoke my soul
The wind takes the leaves where he
Wants them to go
His tunes enchant our world,
Our thoughts and leave us frozen 

In this heart of mine
It's you I find
Take my hand
I'll take you to the promised land
You're the one 

Nevil, whatever you have done, these tears
Will fade
Nevil, wherever you have gone,
Please have faith 





  2. **Another Day**
I know you're going away
I take my love into another day
In my thoughts you're with me
I fell in love with your ways 

I know you're going away
Lead my heart into a daze
I know you're going away
Leaves a void in my heart and soul 

Wherever you are
Whatever you do
I feel the walls surrounding you 

Wherever you are
Whatever you do
I know you are independent
But I'm trying to get through to you 

Wherever you are
Whatever you do
Don't you know, it depends on you 





  3. **The Other Half (Of me)**
Over the hills lies a new beginning
Over the hills
Over the hills there is a way I know it
Over the hills

You can't brighten at the gloom
-Your heart is afraid and so empty
You glorify the future
-Living in a different world than me
This journey ends in death
-You are giving up so easily

You are the other half of me

Over the hills [x4]

We are drifting apart
- Chilled to the marrow 'cause you don't want to go

We've got a different wish at heart
- The Amulet guides us to other side

When I go down, it's you who'll bleed
- I'm not scared to die, as long as I'm with you

You are the other half of me

Over the hills lies a new beginning
Over the hills
Over the hills there is a way I know it
Over the hills
