Akhirnya saya menemukan lagi 1 group band dengan vokalis cewek :) yang membawa aliran [Symphonic Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal). Mungkin buat teman-teman pecinta aliran [Symphonic Metal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_metal) pasti udah tahu donk group band [Xandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xandria) ini :) Nah dari ke 5 album [Xandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xandria) (yaitu _[Kill_the_Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Sun) , [Ravenheart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenheart), [India](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_(album)), [Salome_-_The_Seventh_Veil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salom%C3%A9_-_The_Seventh_Veil) dan [Now and Forever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_%26_Forever_-_Best_of_Xandria)_) yang menurut saya paling bagus (soalnya ini yang sering saya denger :D ) yaitu :



### Sister Of The Light dari Album Salome The Seventh Veil



Yang saya seneng dari lagu ini adalah intronya :) Menurut saya hm.., asyik banget suasananya kek ada suara ketipung-ketipung-nya gitu :D (eh bener ga yah :P :)) ) , ini klo mau lyrics-nya sekalian :
**Lyrics:**
follow me through the night
we are the sisters of the light

Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are daughters of sin
We are laughter in the wind
Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are wild, we are free
Through the darkness follow me!

I am here to break the silence and
I want you to be the voice of mine

follow me follow me follow me now

Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are daughters of sin
We are laughter in the wind
Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are wild, we are free
Through the darkness follow me

You alone, you can let time stand still and
You create the missing element

We're the fires of hell
We're the deep rough sea
We're the stormy air
We are we
We're the ashes of time
And we are banshee
Through the darkness, sisters,
Follow me!

follow me follow me follow me now

Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are daughters of sin
We are laughter in the wind
Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are wild, we are free
Through the darkness follow me

sisters of the light
sisters of the light

Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are daughters of sin
We are laughter in the wind
Follow me through the night
We are sisters of the light
We are wild, we are free
Through the darkness follow me

we are sisters of the light

### Ravenheart dari Album Ravenheart



Karena pertama saya denger ya lihat dari [youtube](www.youtube.com)-nya, jadinya langsung jatuh cinta dah :) Suasanna di video clip-nya sangat cocok menurut saya :D Apalagi ada suara burung gagak-nya segala, hm... makin keren jadinya :)
**Lyrics:**
Come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil

You shadow of forgotten dreams
You come to take away
My hope on your black wings

Come on come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still left lonely

Of love & hate the singers tell
But I feel more, more of both,
More than heaven & hell
I take a bow to destiny
Now I have really learned my part
Once loving him, now hating love
I've made mistakes, my Ravenheart

So come on come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still lonely

Will I get back who I adore?
Thus spoke the raven: nevermore

Come on come to me, Ravenheart
Messenger of evil
Come to me. What's the news?
Here I'm still lonely

Come to me [come to me], Ravenheart [Ravenheart]
Messenger of evil [Messenger of evil]
Come to me [come to me]. What's the news? [What's the news?]
Here I'm still lonely



### Now And Forever dari Album India



Kalau yang ini  lagunya emang menurut saya bikin semangat :) dan yang paling saya senangi ada di bagian **reff**-nya :)) (Maklum yang apal cuma itu doank :P )
**Lyrics:**
Millions of songs all these years in my soul
And when we met I just knew they´re for you
Now your voice is singing them all
Your wings at mine we will never fall

On and on
We will fly now & forever
Side to side now & forever my love

Thousands of miles through the cold stormy air
There´s really nothing that I wouldn´t dare
I climb the eye of the hurricane
When the winds are whispering your name

On and on
We will fly now & forever
Side to side now & forever my love



### Vampire dari Album Salome The Seventh Veil



**Lyrics:**
Dark are the streets, gloom's creeping out of the walls
Dirt comes alive and all the neon-lights call
Demons and fools and a lady of black
She's of the kind nighttime-insomniac

She sees the pray and she's aware
The times are hard but she don't care

She's a vampire
Desire darker than black
She's a vampire
Reach higher, no turning back
Her wings are curtains of the night
She knows no wrong or right

Dead are the places where this goddess has been
Cold is the skin that this creature has seen
Her universe is an ocean of blood
Her dining table the cradle of mud

She sees the prey and she's aware
The times are hard but she don't care

She's a vampire
Desire darker than black
She's a vampire
Reach higher, no turning back
Her wings are curtains of the night
She knows no wrong or right

The night is blind, the mistress she is calling you
To be by her side forevermore
Follow her until her thirst is sated
An immortal lie, heartblood

Can't help yourself, she's got you paralyzed

So would you kiss the sun goodbye?
And give your life to never die?

She's a vampire
Desire darker than black
She's a vampire
Reach higher, no turning back
She's a vampire
Desire darker than black
She's a vampire
Reach higher, no turning back



### Save My Life dari Album Salome The Seventh Veil



Lagu ini kalem, tapi **reff-nya** keren loh :) Kwkwkwk menurut saya tapinya :)
**Lyrics:**
My Soul feels empty
I'm drowning in my tears
It's pain I'm learning
My Heart is aching
Got poison in my veins
In hell I'm burning

Save my life
Save my life
Let these tears be our secret
My You and I
You and I
Once we were so close
Save my life

It's all or nothing
I'm asking you to give
Let live or die
Everything is better
Than this silent lie
Say that it's no lie!

Save my life
Save my life
Let these tears be our secret
You and I
You and I
Once we were so close
Save my life

I need you to save my life

Save my life
Save my life
Let these tears be our secret
You and I
You and I
Once we were so close
Save my life
Save my life
Let me feel you breathing
In your hands
In your hands
Is the heart of mine
Save my life
