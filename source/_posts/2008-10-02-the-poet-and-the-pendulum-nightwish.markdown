**Lyrics:**
The end
The songwriter’s dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white land of empathica, of innocence
The poet meadows of heaven
The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widow writer, torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
Yet still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer’s hideaway
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for "God save me"
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
My home was there at last, these meadows of heaven
The venture filled days more with every smiling face
Please, no more words
Those from a seventh hell
No more, please, tell me once my heart goes by
Take me home
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer’s hideaway
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for "God save me"
I cannot cry ’cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Sparkle, a scenery
With childish lies, I fall
With beauty underneath
The end, I’m free
Tuck me in
Beneath the blue
Beneath the great
Beneath the ray
One night reigns a journey in time
See them, the light
On the shore he sat and hoped
Under the same belief
Blue sky, the light chose you
Shows you hope
Be still my sun, you're home
Oh, when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save the love, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end, I will always love you
