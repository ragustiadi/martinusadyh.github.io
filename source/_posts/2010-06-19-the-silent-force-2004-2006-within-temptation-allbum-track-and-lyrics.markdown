[![The Silent Force](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4672153439_9c4d9da140.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/10243554@N02/4672153439/)T-Net... diwarnet inilah awalnya saya mendengarkan lagu dari album "The Silent Force" ini, T-Net jugalah warnet satu-satu-nya di Kediri yang kental dengan nuansa METAL karena semua operator-nya maniak musik-musik cadas (hii Ux, kang Ed) dan ada juga operator yang side job-nya adalah ngebuka kursus gitar (kadang-kadang jadi panitia konser punk juga klo ga salah) :D :) Gara-gara album ini juga, saya akhirnya menjadi penggemar aliran Symphonic/Gothic Metal dan mulai mencari-cari band dengan aliran sejenis yang akhirnya ketemu dengan Nightwish, Epica, Lacuna Coil, After Forever, Delain dan Xandria :) Sebenarnya masih banyak lagi sih band-band yang lain, cuma saya belum sempat dengerin musiknya :D :)

The Silent Force ini merupakan album ketiga dari Within Temptation yang di release pada tanggal 15 November 2004 oleh [Gun Records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUN_Records). Album ini di release tiga versi yaitu **basic version**, **standart version** dan **premium version**, untuk **premium version** terdapat 2 bonus track :) Kabar lainnya adalah album ini meraih Gold status di negara Jerman, Belanda, Belgia dan Finlandia setelah 1 minggu di release. Dan pada tanggal 5 Agustus 2008, album "The Silent Force" beserta album "Mother Earth" di release di Amerika dibawah bendera Roadrunner Records.

Yang mengejutkan lagi, album The Silent Force ini (atau setidaknya judul album ini) terinspirasi dari judul buku pada awal abad ke 19 yang ditulis oleh penulis Belanda yang masa muda-nya dahulu pernah bersekolah di Batavia (sekarang Jakarta - Indonesia) bernama [Louis Couperus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couperus). Pernyataan ini dikatakan sendiri oleh Sharon den Adel dalam sebuah wawancara dengan Buzznet yang membahas judul album, dan inilah kutipan Sharon den Adel tersebut :


> 
"The title of our latest album 'The Silent Force' is actually taken from the title of a book from the beginning of the 19th century from a Dutch writer (who lived in Indonesia when he was young) called Louis Couperus. All the songs on this album are in some way related to that book (or at least the title)."

  1. **Intro**
[Instrumental]





  2. **See Who I Am**
Is it true what they say,
Are we too blind to find the way?
Fear of the unknown cloud our hearts today.
Come into my world,
See through my eyes.
Try to understand,
Don't want to lose what we have

We've been dreaming
But who can deny,
It's the best way of living
Between the truth and the lies

See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,
This is not the end.

Fear is withering the soul
At the point of no return.
We must be the change
We wish to see.
I'll come into your world,
See through your eyes.
I'll try to understand,
Before we lose what we've had.

We just can't stop believing
'Cause we have to try.
We can rise above
Their truth and their lies.

See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,

See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,
This is not the end.

Hear the silence
Preaching my blame.
Will our strength remain
If their power reigns?

See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,

See who I am,
Break through the surface.
Reach for my hand,
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way.
The world is in our hands,
This is not the end.





  3. **Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)**
I've been dreaming for so long,
to find a meaning to understand.
The secret of life,
why am I here to try again?

Will I always, will you always
see the truth when it stares you in the face?
Will I ever, will I never free myself
by breaking these chains?

I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back, it's my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
have to live till it's undone.
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.

I've been living for so long,
many seasons have passed me by.
I've seen kingdoms through ages
rise and fall, I've seen it all.

I've seen the horror, I've seen the wonders
happening just in front of my eyes.
Will I ever, will I never free myself by making it right?

I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back, it's my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
have to live till it's undone.
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.

Jillian our dream ended long ago.
All our stories and all our glory I held so dear.
We won't be together
for ever and ever, no more tears.
I'll always be here until the end.
Jillian, no more tears
Jillian, no more tears

I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back, it's my fault.
Your destiny is forlorn,
have to live till it's undone.
I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul.
I'd turn it back and then at last I'll be on my way.





  4. **Stand My Ground**
I can see
when you stay low nothing happens
Does it feel right?

Late at night
things I thought I'd put behind me
haunt my mind

I just know there's no escape now
once it's set its eyes on you
but I won't run, have to stare it in the eye

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand My Ground

It's all around
getting stronger, coming closer
into my world

I can feel
that it's time for me to face it
can I take it?

Though this might just be the ending
of the life I held so dear
but I won't run, there's no turning back from here

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand My Ground

All I know for sure is I'm trying
I will always stand my ground

Stand my ground, I won't give in (I won't give in)
I won't give up (I won't give up)
no more denying, I got to face it
won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
if I don't make it, someone else will

Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I gotta face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand My Ground.





  5. **Pale**
The world seems not the same,
Though I know nothing has changed.
It's all my state of mind,
I can't leave it all behind.
Have to stand up to be stronger.

Have to try to break free
From the thoughts in my mind.
Use the time that I have,
I can't say goodbye,
Have to make it right.
Have to fight, cause I know
In the end it's worthwhile,
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away.
It will be alright.

I know, should realize
Time is precious, it is worthwhile.
Despite how I feel inside,
Have to trust it'll be all right.
Have to stand up to be stronger.

I have to try to break free
From the thoughts in my mind.
Use the time that I have,
I can't say goodbye,
Have to make it right.
Have to fight, cause I know
In the end it's worthwhile,
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away.
It will be all right.

Oh, this night is too long.
Have no strength to go on.
No more pain, I'm floating away.
Through the mist see the face
Of an angel, who calls my name.
I remember you're the reason I have to stay.

Have to try to break free
From the thoughts in my mind.
Use the time that I have,
I can't say goodbye,
Have to make it right.
Have to fight, cause I know
In the end it's worthwhile,
That the pain that I feel slowly fades away.
It will be alright.





  6. **Forsaken**
Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time

We lived our lives in our paradise,
As gods we shaped the world around
No borderlines we'd stay behind,
Though balance is something fragile

While we thought we were gaining,
We'd turn back the tide, it still slips away
Our time has run out, our future has doubt,
There's no more escape

Now the day has come,
We are forsaken,
There's no time anymore
Life will pass us by,
We are forsaken,
We're the last of our kind

The sacrifice was much too high,
Our greed just made us all go blind
We tried to hide what we feared inside
Today is the end of tomorrow

As the sea started rising,
The land that we conquered just washed away
Although we all have tried to turn back the tide,
It was all in vain

Now the day has come,
We are forsaken,
There's no time anymore
Life will pass us by, we are forsaken,
Only ruins stay behind

Now the day has come
We are forsaken this time

Now the day has come,
We are forsaken,
There's no time anymore

Now the day has come
The day has come
The day has come.





  7. **Angels**
Sparkling angel I believe
You were my savior in my time of need.
Blinded by faith I couldn't hear
All the whispers, the warnings so clear.
I see the angels,
I'll lead them to your door.
There's no escape now,
No mercy no more.
No remorse cause I still remember

The smile when you tore me apart.
You took my heart,
Deceived me right from the start.
You showed me dreams,
I wished they'd turn into real.
You broke a promise and made me realize.
It was all just a lie.

Sparkling angel, I couldn't see
Your dark intentions, your feelings for me.
Fallen angel, tell me why?
What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?
I see the angels,
I'll lead them to your door
There's no escape now
No mercy no more
No remorse cause I still remember

The smile when you tore me apart
You took my heart,
Deceived me right from the start.
You showed me dreams,
I wished they'd turn into real.
You broke a promise and made me realize.
It was all just a lie.
Could have been forever.
Now we have reached the end.

This world may have failed you,
It doesn't give you reason why.
You could have chosen a different path in life.

The smile when you tore me apart.
You took my heart,
Deceived me right from the start.
You showed me dreams,
I wished they'd turn into real.
You broke a promise and made me realize.
It was all just a lie.
Could have been forever.
Now we have reached the end.





  8. **Memories**
In this world you tried,
Not leaving me alone behind.
There's no other way,
I pray to the gods let him stay.
The memories ease the pain inside,
And now I know why.

All of my memories keep you near.
In silent moments,
Imagining you here.
All of my memories keep you near,
In silent whispers, by silent tears

Made me promise I'd try,
To find my way back in this life.
Hope there is a way,
To give me a sign you're okay.
Reminds me again it's worth it all,
So I can go home.

All of my memories keep you near.
In silent moments,
Imagining you here.
All of my memories keep you near.
In silent whispers, by silent tears.

Together in all these memories,
I see your smile.
All of the memories I hold dear.
Darling you know I'll love you,
Til the end of time.

All of my memories keep you near
In silent moments,
Imagining you here.
All of my memories keep you near,
In silent whispers, by silent tears.

All of my memories...





  9. **Aquarius**
I hear your whispers
break the silence and it calms me down.
A taste on my lips,
your salty kisses.

They say I'm seeking out the danger.
That one day you won't let me go.
I'll drown, you'll take me down.

Chorus:
I need you Aquarius,
enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.
You call to me, you set me free.

I relinquish to your powers.
From your grasp, I just can't hide.
I missed the danger I had to conquer.
You made me feel alive.

They say I have to be aware,
that one day you won't let me go.
I'll drown, you'll take me down.

I need you Aquarius,
enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.

I long for you, Aquarius.
I need to be with you again.
I fear you, Aquarius
My destiny till the end.

I need you Aquarius,
enchanted I will have to stay
I feel you Aquarius
cause you the sea set me free.





  10. **It's the Fear**
It waits for the day I will let it out.
To give it a reason, to give it its might.

I fear who I am becoming,
I feel that I am losing the struggle within.
I can no longer restrain it,
My strength it is fading,
I have to give in.

It's the fear
Fear of the dark
It's growing inside of me,
That one day will come to life.
Have to save
To save my beloved,
There is no escape,
Because my faith is horror and doom.

Hold down your head now,
Just let me pass by.
Don't feed my fear,
If you don't want it out.

I fear who I am becoming,
I feel that I am losing all beauty within.
I can no longer restrain it,
My strength is fading.
I have to give in.

It's the fear
Fear of the dark
It's growing inside of me,
That one day will come to life.
Have to save
To save my beloved,
There is no escape,
Because my faith is horror and doom.

Long ago it came to me
And ever since that day,
Infected with its rage
But it ends today.

It's the fear
Fear of the dark
It's growing inside of me,
That one day will come to life.
Have to save
To save my beloved,
There is no escape,
Because my faith is horror and doom. 





  11. **Somewhere**
Lost in the darkness, hoping for a sign
Instead there is only silence,
Can't you hear my screams?
Never stop hoping,
Need to know where you are
But one thing's for sure,
You're always in my heart

I'll find you somewhere
I'll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever has happened,
The truth will free my soul

Lost in the darkness, try to find your way home
I want to embrace you and never let you go
Almost hope you're in heaven so no one can hurt your soul
Living in agony 'cause I just do not know
Where you are

I'll find you somewhere
I'll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever's happened,
The truth will free my soul

Wherever you are, I won't stop searching
Whatever it takes me to go

I'll find you somewhere
I'll keep on trying until my dying day
I just need to know whatever's happened,
The truth will free my soul





  12. **A Dangerous Mind**
I'm searching for answers
Cause something is not right.
I follow the signs,
I'm close to the fire.

I fear that soon you'll reveal
Your dangerous mind.

It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I fear your smile and the promise inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I fear your presence, I'm frozen inside.

I'm searching for answers
Not questioned before.
The curse of awareness,
There's no peace of mind.
As your true colors show
A dangerous sign.

It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I see the truth that you've buried inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find.

I just have to know, while I still have time.
Do I have to run, or hide away from you?

It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I see the truth that you've buried inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find.

It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I see the truth that you've buried inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find. I find





  13. **The Swan Song**
Winter has come for me, can't carry on.
The chains to my life are strong but soon they'll be gone.
I'll spread my wings one more time.

Is it a dream?
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.

In my heart I know I can let go.
In the end I will find some peace inside.
New wings are growing tonight.

Is it a dream?
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.

As I am soaring I'm one with the wind.
I am longing to see you again, it's been so long.
We will be together again.

Is it a dream?
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.
The sun warms my face.
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.
