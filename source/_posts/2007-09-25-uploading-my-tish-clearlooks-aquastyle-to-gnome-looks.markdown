Yeah, it is my first GTK+ themes for [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) :) And i added this to [ GNOME-Looks](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=66876) to share my modified themes with other [GNOME lover's](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=66876) :) . And this is the screenshot of my Tish-Clearlooks-AquaStyle :

Below this guide to use this themes :




  1. Un-compress [Tish-Clearlooks-AquaStyle](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/download.php?content=66876&id=1) and put in your /home/your_userame/.themes/ directory 


  2. Right Click onto the top panel, and chose properties. In Panel Properties, choose advanced tab and select the background image then browse trough Tish-Clearlooks-AquaStyle directory and find panelAtas.png.


  3. Change your button layout from GConf editor and go to /apps/metacity/general, right click the button layout and edit the value for menu to look like this : close,minimize,maximize:menu 


  4. Replace icon with OSX icons. Get OSX icons from [ here ](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/OSX?content=31618)


  5.  The other alternative instead of editing looks from the gconf editor, you can uncompress [gconf.tar.bz ](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/download.php?content=66876&id=2)and replace your /usr/share/pixmaps/gconf-editor directory.
