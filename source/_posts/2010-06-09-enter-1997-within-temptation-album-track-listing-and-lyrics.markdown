  1. **Restless**
She embraced, with a smile,
as she opened the door.
A cold wind blows,
it puts a chill into her heart.

You have taken away the trust,
you're the ghost haunting through her heart.
Past and present are one in her head,
you're the ghost haunting through her heart.

Take my hand as I wander through,
all of my life I gave to you.
Take my hand as I wander through,
all of my love I gave to you.

You have taken away the trust,
you're the ghost haunting through her heart.
Past and present are one in her head,
you're the ghost haunting through her heart.

lailllailllailla.... lailllailllailla 

Take my hand as I wander through,
All of my life I gave to you.
Take my hand as I wander through,
All of my love I gave to you.

laalilalllla..... lailai..iii





  2. **Enter**
The gates of time have opened,
Now, it's chains are broken.
An ancient force unleashed again

As I enter the portal,
I feel the enchantment
It takes me away, away from here

Come near me,
enter my private chambers,
I want to feel the warmth on my face,
light-in darkness,
lift me up from here.
Give me your wings,
to flee from my ivory tower.

As I enter the portal,
I feel the enchantment
The stars above are lying at my feet.

Come near me,
enter my private chambers,
I want to feel the warmth on my face,
light-in darkness,
lift me up from here.
Give me your wings,
to flee from my ivory tower.





  3. **Pearls of Light**
After,
the cold darkness,
in the heart of the forest.
Where birds are singing,
for the new born sun

In the womb of the leaves,
on the branches of the trees,
lies the treasure in the morning,
the pearls of light.

Carried away by the truculence of my world,
I got lost in the search for enlightenment,
The blue rain,
Covered my roots and I forgot where I came from.

Carried away by the truculence of my world,
I got lost in the search for enlightment,
The blue rain,
Covered my roots and I forgot where I came from.





  4. **Deep Within**
Is there a place deep within
A place where you hide your darkest sins

There's a strange kind of ambiance,
its surrounding you
as a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth

Candles die down as you leave the room
In my heart you leave no gloom
As you lure me I know the truth
You're a leprechaun, I see you through.

Is there a place deep within
A place where you hide your darkest sins

There's a strange kind of ambiance,
its surrounding you
as a songstress you lure me,
towards the truth





  5. **Gatekeeper**
The shadows of the night,
are unleashed again
Where their greed begins,
the end is near
A morbid hunger for blood,
lies in their cold black eyes
They've come to take our lifes away

One by one they died
A massacre that took all night
They had no chance, it was no fight
You can't kill what has been killed before
They died.....

With shadows on its tail
He stepped through the portal,
locked the door and ate the key
With his life they took their way to freedom,
and he became the final keeper of the key





  6. **Grace**
Cold are the bones of thy soldiers.
Longing for home, their little paradise.
I don't feel remdeption on their side

Fallen from grace, help me rise again.
Fallen from grace, help me through.

Fallen from grace, help me through.
Fallen from grace.

Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble.

Do you hear these words.
Do you feel the wounds.
I'll never help you through.

Cold are thy souls,
I feel the resentment,
they feel betrayed,
They hate the cold
I don't feel redemption on their side.

Fallen from grace, help me rise again.
Fallen from grace, help me through.





  7. **Blooded**
[instrumental]




  8. **Candles**
Take away,
These hands of darkness.
Reaching for my soul.
Now, the cold wind, blows out my candles.
Feeling, only fear, without any hope.

A thousand dark moons.
A thousand winters long.
A million fallen stars, the candle burns in the womb.

We try not to forget, they live through us.
Slowly they die away at every candle's end.

A thousand dark moons.
A thousand winters long.
A million fallen stars, the candle burns in the womb.

We trie not to forget, they live through us.
Slowly they die away at every candle's end.
